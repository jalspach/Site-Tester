# Site-Tester
Tool to test multiple sites before a roll out.
This script runs a series of tests to verify the pre and later post install status.
WARNING...this code is UGLY and not nearly as clean as it should be...in fact it hardly gets the job done. BUT...it DOES get the job done so it is what it is.
This script requires the following packages be installed manually, as of the current version:
iperf3
speedtest-cli
nuttcp
